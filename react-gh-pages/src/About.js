          <p id="about"> There was once a young programmer named David Zhang. He was first exposed to code back in 2011 when he first joined a robotics team during high school. From there, he enrolled into University of California, Riverside and discovered his passion for creating video games and software development. Enamored by what people can do by combining design, code, and perserverance, David worked on projects he loved alongside amazing companions in the teams he collaborated with. Throughout his college life he engaged himself in different projects through passion projects, hackathons, game jams, research, and an internship. Learn more about him here!</p>
          <p id="about">David is currently based in Seattle Washington and works at Amazon as a software development engineer. If you are nearby, feel free to contact him and say hello! </p>
